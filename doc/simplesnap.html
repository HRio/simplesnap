>Description</H2
><P
>      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>simplesnap</SPAN
> is a simple way to send ZFS snapshots across a
      network.  Although it can serve many purposes, its primary goal
      is to manage backups from one ZFS filesystem to a backup
      filesystem also running ZFS, using incremental backups to
      minimize network traffic and disk usage.
    </P

>      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>simplesnap</SPAN
> is <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>FLEXIBLE</I
></SPAN
>; it is designed to
      perfectly compliment snapshotting tools, permitting rotating
      backups with arbitrary retention periods.  It lets multiple
      machines back up a single target, lets one machine back up
      multiple targets, and keeps it all straight.

><P
>      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>EASY</I
></SPAN
>; there is no
      configuration file needed.  One ZFS property is available to
      exclude datasets/filesystems.  ZFS datasets are automatically
      discovered on machines being backed up.

><P

      tools, it does not require full root access to the machines
      being backed up.  It runs only a small wrapper as root, and the
      wrapper has only three commands it implements.

            a snapshot auto-rotator on both ends (such as zfSnap).  simplesnap
            will transfer snapshots made by other tools, but will not destroy
            them on either end.

><P
>            Requires ssh public key authorization to the host being backed up,
            but does not require permission to run arbitrary commands.  It has
            a wrapper to run on the backup host, written in bash, which accepts
            only three operations and performs them simply.  It is suitable for
            a locked-down authorized_keys file.

>Method of Operation</H3
><P
>        <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

      </P
><P
>        The <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>simplesnap</B
> program runs on the machine
        that stores the backups -- we'll call it the backuphost.
        There is a restricted remote command wrapper called
        <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>simplesnapwrap</B
> that runs on the machine
        being backed up -- we'll call it the activehost.
        <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>simplesnapwrap</B
> is never invoked directly by
        the end-user; it is always called remotely by
        <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>simplesnap</B
>.
      </P
><P
>        With <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>simplesnap</SPAN
>, the backuphost always connects to the
        activehost -- never the other way round.
      </P
><P
>        <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>simplesnap</B
> runs in the backuphost, and
        first connects to the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>simplesnapwrap</B
> on the
        activehost and asks it for a
        list of the ZFS datasets ("listfs" operation).  <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>simplesnapwrap</B
>
        responds with a list of all ZFS datasets that were not flagged for
        exclusion.
      </P
><P
>        Next, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>simplesnap</B
> connects back to <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>simplesnapwrap</B
> once for each dataset
        to be backed up -- the "sendback" operation.  <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>simplesnap</B
> passes along
        to it only two things: the setname and the dataset
        (filesystem) name.
      </P
><P
>        <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>simplesnapwrap</B
> looks to see if there is an existing simplesnap
        snapshot corresponding to that <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>SETNAME</I
></TT
>.  If not, it creates one and
        sends it as a full, non-incremental backup.  That completes the job
        for that dataset.
      </P
><P
>        If there is an existing snapshot for that <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>SETNAME</I
></TT
>, simplesnapwrap
        creates a new one, constructing the snapshot name containing a
        timestamp and the <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>SETNAME</I
></TT
>, then sends an incremental, using the oldest
        snapshot from that setname as the basis for zfs send -I.
      </P
><P
>        After the backuphost has observed <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>zfs receive</B
> exiting without error,
        it contacts <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>simplesnapwrap</B
> once more and requests the "reap"
        operation.  This cleans up the old snapshots for the given <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>SETNAME</I
></TT
>,
        leaving only the most recent.  This is a separate operation in
        <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>simplesnapwrap</B
> ensuring that even if the transmission is interrupted,
        still it will be OK in the end because <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>zfs receive -F</B
> is used, and the
        data will come across next time.
      </P
><P
>        The idea is that some system like <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>zfSnap</B
> will be used on both ends to
        make periodic snapshots and clean them up.  One can use careful prefix
        names with zfSnap to use different prefixes on each serverhost, and
        then implement custom cleanup rules with -F on the holderhost.

    </P

    </P
><P

      <TT

>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</TT

      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>~/.ssh/id_rsa_simplesnap.pub</TT
> from the backuphost.  (Or, add to the
      end, if you already have lines in the file.)  Then, at the
      beginning of that one very long line, add text like this:
    </P

      be on a single line in your file.)
    </P
><P

></TT
> is the IP address that
      connections from the backuphost
      will appear to come from.  It may be omitted if the IP is not static,
      but it affords a little extra security.  The line will wind up looking
      like:

    </P

    </P
><P
>      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_simplesnap serverhost</B

    </P
><P

      file.  At this point, you should see output containing:
    </P
><P
>      "simplesnapwrap: This program is to be run from ssh."
    </P
><P
>      If you see that, then simplesnapwrap was properly invoked
      remotely.
    </P
><P
>      Now, create a ZFS filesystem to hold your backups.  For
      instance:
    </P
><P
>      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>zfs create tank/simplesnap</B

    </P

        --store tank/simplesnap
        --sshcmd "ssh -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa_simplesnap"
      </B

    </P
><P
>      You can monitor progress in <TT
