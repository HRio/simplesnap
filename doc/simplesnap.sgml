    <title>Description</title>


    <para>
      &simplesnap; is a simple way to send ZFS snapshots across a
      network.  Although it can serve many purposes, its primary goal
      is to manage backups from one ZFS filesystem to a backup
      filesystem also running ZFS, using incremental backups to
      minimize network traffic and disk usage.
    </para>

    <para>
      &simplesnap; is <emphasis>FLEXIBLE</emphasis>; it is designed to
      perfectly compliment snapshotting tools, permitting rotating
      backups with arbitrary retention periods.  It lets multiple
      machines back up a single target, lets one machine back up
      multiple targets, and keeps it all straight.
    </para>

    <para>
      &simplesnap; is <emphasis>EASY</emphasis>; there is no
      configuration file needed.  One ZFS property is available to
      exclude datasets/filesystems.  ZFS datasets are automatically
      discovered on machines being backed up.
    </para>

    <para>
      &simplesnap; is <emphasis>SAFE</emphasis>; it is robust in the
      face of interrupted transfers, and needs little help to keep
      running.
    </para>

    <para>
      &simplesnap; is <emphasis>SECURE</emphasis>; unlike many similar
      tools, it does not require full root access to the machines
      being backed up.  It runs only a small wrapper as root, and the
      wrapper has only three commands it implements.
    </para>

      </para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>
            Does one thing and does it well.  It is designed to be used with
            a snapshot auto-rotator on both ends (such as zfSnap).  simplesnap
            will transfer snapshots made by other tools, but will not destroy
            them on either end.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem><para>
            Requires ssh public key authorization to the host being backed up,
            but does not require permission to run arbitrary commands.  It has
            a wrapper to run on the backup host, written in bash, which accepts
            only three operations and performs them simply.  It is suitable for
            a locked-down authorized_keys file.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem><para>
            Creates minimal snapshots for its own internal purposes, generally
            leaving no more than 1 or 2 per dataset, and reaps them
            automatically without touching others.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem><para>
            Is a small program, easily audited.  In fact, most of the code is devoted to sanity-checking, security, and error
            checking.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem><para>
            Automatically discovers what datasets to back up from the remote.
            Uses a user-defined zfs property to exclude filesystems that should
            not be backed up.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem><para>
            Logs copiously to syslog on all hosts involved in backups.

        </listitem>

        <listitem><para>
            Intelligently supports a single machine being backed up by multiple
            backup hosts, or onto multiple sets of backup media (when, for
            instance, backup media is cycled into offsite storage)
