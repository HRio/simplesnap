    <title>Description</title>


    <para>
      &simplesnap; is a simple way to send ZFS snapshots across a
      network.  Although it can serve many purposes, its primary goal
      is to manage backups from one ZFS filesystem to a backup
      filesystem also running ZFS, using incremental backups to
      minimize network traffic and disk usage.
    </para>

    <para>
      &simplesnap; is <emphasis>FLEXIBLE</emphasis>; it is designed to
      perfectly compliment snapshotting tools, permitting rotating
      backups with arbitrary retention periods.  It lets multiple
      machines back up a single target, lets one machine back up
      multiple targets, and keeps it all straight.
    </para>

    <para>
      &simplesnap; is <emphasis>EASY</emphasis>; there is no
      configuration file needed.  One ZFS property is available to
      exclude datasets/filesystems.  ZFS datasets are automatically
      discovered on machines being backed up.
    </para>

    <para>
      &simplesnap; is <emphasis>SAFE</emphasis>; it is robust in the
      face of interrupted transfers, and needs little help to keep
      running.
    </para>

    <para>
      &simplesnap; is <emphasis>SECURE</emphasis>; unlike many similar
      tools, it does not require full root access to the machines
      being backed up.  It runs only a small wrapper as root, and the
      wrapper has only three commands it implements.
    </para>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Feature List</title>
      <para>
        Besides the above, &simplesnap;:
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>
            Does one thing and does it well.  It is designed to be used with
            a snapshot auto-rotator on both ends (such as zfSnap).  simplesnap
            will transfer snapshots made by other tools, but will not destroy
            them on either end.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem><para>
            Requires ssh public key authorization to the host being backed up,
            but does not require permission to run arbitrary commands.  It has
            a wrapper to run on the backup host, written in bash, which accepts
            only three operations and performs them simply.  It is suitable for
            a locked-down authorized_keys file.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem><para>
            Creates minimal snapshots for its own internal purposes, generally
            leaving no more than 1 or 2 per dataset, and reaps them
            automatically without touching others.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem><para>
            Is a small program, easily audited.  In fact, most of the code is devoted to sanity-checking, security, and error
            checking.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem><para>
            Automatically discovers what datasets to back up from the remote.
            Uses a user-defined zfs property to exclude filesystems that should
            not be backed up.

        <listitem><para>
            Intelligently supports a single machine being backed up by multiple
            backup hosts, or onto multiple sets of backup media (when, for

      <title>Method of Operation</title>
      <para>
        &simplesnap;'s operation is very simple.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <command>simplesnap</command> program runs on the machine
        that stores the backups -- we'll call it the backuphost.
        There is a restricted remote command wrapper called
        <command>simplesnapwrap</command> that runs on the machine
        being backed up -- we'll call it the activehost.
        <command>simplesnapwrap</command> is never invoked directly by
        the end-user; it is always called remotely by
        <command>simplesnap</command>.
      </para>
      <para>
        With &simplesnap;, the backuphost always connects to the
        activehost -- never the other way round.
      </para>
      <para>
        <command>simplesnap</command> runs in the backuphost, and
        first connects to the <command>simplesnapwrap</command> on the
        activehost and asks it for a
        list of the ZFS datasets ("listfs" operation).  <command>simplesnapwrap</command>
        responds with a list of all ZFS datasets that were not flagged for
        exclusion.
      </para>

      <para>
        Next, <command>simplesnap</command> connects back to <command>simplesnapwrap</command> once for each dataset
        to be backed up -- the "sendback" operation.  <command>simplesnap</command> passes along
        to it only two things: the setname and the dataset
        (filesystem) name.
      </para>

      <para>
        <command>simplesnapwrap</command> looks to see if there is an existing simplesnap
        snapshot corresponding to that <replaceable>SETNAME</replaceable>.  If not, it creates one and
        sends it as a full, non-incremental backup.  That completes the job
        for that dataset.
      </para>

      <para>
        If there is an existing snapshot for that <replaceable>SETNAME</replaceable>, simplesnapwrap
        creates a new one, constructing the snapshot name containing a
        timestamp and the <replaceable>SETNAME</replaceable>, then sends an incremental, using the oldest
        snapshot from that setname as the basis for zfs send -I.
      </para>

      <para>
        After the backuphost has observed <command>zfs receive</command> exiting without error,
        it contacts <command>simplesnapwrap</command> once more and requests the "reap"
        operation.  This cleans up the old snapshots for the given <replaceable>SETNAME</replaceable>,
        leaving only the most recent.  This is a separate operation in
        <command>simplesnapwrap</command> ensuring that even if the transmission is interrupted,
        still it will be OK in the end because <command>zfs receive -F</command> is used, and the
        data will come across next time.
      </para>

      <para>
        The idea is that some system like <command>zfSnap</command> will be used on both ends to
        make periodic snapshots and clean them up.  One can use careful prefix
        names with zfSnap to use different prefixes on each serverhost, and
        then implement custom cleanup rules with -F on the holderhost.
      </para>

  <refsect1>
    <title>Quick Start</title>

    <para>
      This section will describe how a first-time &simplesnap; user
      can get up and running quickly.  It assumes you already have
      &simplesnap; installed and working on your system.  If not,
      please follow the instructions in the
      <filename>INSTALL.txt</filename> file in the source
      distribution.
    </para>

    <para>
      As above, I will refer to the machine storing the backups as the
      "backuphost" and the machine being backed up as the
      "activehost".
    </para>
    <para>
      First, on the backuphost, as root, generate an ssh keypair that
      will be used exclusively for &simplesnap;.
    </para>

    <para>
      <command>ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_simplesnap</command>
    </para>

    <para>
      When prompted for a passphrase, leave it empty.
    </para>

    <para>
      Now, on the activehost, edit or create a file called
      <filename>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</filename>.  Initialize it with the content of
      <filename>~/.ssh/id_rsa_simplesnap.pub</filename> from the backuphost.  (Or, add to the
      end, if you already have lines in the file.)  Then, at the
      beginning of that one very long line, add text like this:
    </para>

    <programlisting><![CDATA[
command="/usr/sbin/simplesnapwrap",from="1.2.3.4",
no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-pty 
]]></programlisting>

    <para>
      (I broke that line into two for readability, but this must all
      be on a single line in your file.)
    </para>

    <para>
      The <replaceable>1.2.3.4</replaceable> is the IP address that
      connections from the backuphost
      will appear to come from.  It may be omitted if the IP is not static,
      but it affords a little extra security.  The line will wind up looking
      like:
    </para>

    <programlisting<![CDATA[
command="/usr/sbin/simplesnapwrap",from="1.2.3.4",
no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-pty ssh-rsa AAAA....
]]></programlisting>

    <para>
      (Again, this should all be on one huge line.)
    </para>
    <para>
      If there are any ZFS datasets you do not want to be backed up, set
      <parameter>org.complete.simplesnap:exclude</parameter> property
      on the activehost
      to <parameter>on</parameter>.  For instance:
    </para>
    <para>
      <command>zfs set org.complete.simplesnap:exclude=on
      tank/junkdata</command>
    </para>
    <para>
      Now, back on the backuphost, you should be able to run:
    </para>
    <para>
      <command>ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_simplesnap serverhost</command>
    </para>
    <para>
      say yes when asked if you want to add the key to the known_hosts
      file.  At this point, you should see output containing:
    </para>
    <para>
      "simplesnapwrap: This program is to be run from ssh."
    </para>
    <para>
      If you see that, then simplesnapwrap was properly invoked
      remotely.
    </para>
    <para>
      Now, create a ZFS filesystem to hold your backups.  For
      instance:
    </para>
    <para>
      <command>zfs create tank/simplesnap</command>
    </para>

    <para>
      Now, you can run the backup:
    </para>

    <para>
      <command>simplesnap --host serverhost --setname mainset
        --store tank/simplesnap
        --sshcmd "ssh -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa_simplesnap"
      </command>
    </para>
    <para>
      You can monitor progress in <filename>/var/log/syslog</filename>.  If all goes well, you
      will see filesystems start to be populated under
      <filename>tank/simplesnap/host</filename>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Simple!
    </para>

  </refsect1>

  <refsect1>
    <title>Advanced: SETNAME usage</title>
    <para>
      Most people will always use the same <replaceable>SETNAME</replaceable>.  The <replaceable>SETNAME</replaceable> is used to
      track and name the snapshots on the remote end.  simplesnap tries to always
      leave one snapshot on the remote, to serve as the base for a future
      incremental.
    </para>

    <para>
      In some situations, you may have multiple bases for incrementals.  The
      two primary examples are two different backup servers backing up the
      same machine, or having two sets of backup media and rotating them to
      offsite storage.  In these situations, you will have to keep different
      snapshots on the activehost for the different backups, since they will
      be current to different points in time.
    </para>
  </refsect1>


  <refsect1>
    <title>Options</title>

    <para>
      All &simplesnap; options begin with two dashes (`--').  Most take
      a parameter, which is to be separated from the option by a
      space.  The equals sign is not a valid separator for
      &simplesnap;.
    </para>

    <para>
      The normal &simplesnap; mode is backing up.  An alternative
      check mode is available, which requires fewer parameters.  This
      mode is described below.
    </para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><option>--check <replaceable>TIMEFRAME</replaceable></option>
          <listitem><para>
            Do not back up, but check existing backups.  If any
            datasets' newest backup is older than
          <replaceable>TIMEFRAME</replaceable>, print an error and
            exit with a nonzero code.  Scans all hosts unless a
            specific host is given with <option>--host</option>.  The
            parameter is in the format given to GNU <application>date</application>(1); for
            instance,
            --check "30 days ago".  Remember to enclose it in quotes
            if it contains spaces.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><option>--host</option>
        <replaceable>HOST</replaceable></term>
        <listitem><para>
            Gives the name of the host to back up.  This is both
            passed to ssh and used to name the backup sets.
          </para>
          <para>
            In a few situations, one may not wish to use the same name
            for both.  It is recommend to use the Host and HostName
            options in <filename>~/.ssh/config</filename> to configure aliases in this
            situation.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><option>--local</option>
          <listitem><para>
            Specifies that the host being backed up is local to the
            machine.  Do not use ssh to contact it, and invoke the
            wrapper directly.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><option>--sshcmd
            <replaceable>COMMAND</replaceable></option>
          <listitem><para>
            Gives the command to use to connect to the remote host.
            Defaults to "ssh".  It may be used to select an
            alternative configuration file or keypair.  Remember to
            quote it per your shell if it contains spaces.  For example: 
            --sshcmd "ssh -i /root/.id_rsa_simplesnap".  This command
            is ignored when <option>--local</option> or
            <option>--check</option> is given.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><option>--setname <replaceable>SETNAME</replaceable></option></term>
        <listitem><para>
            Gives the backup set name.  Can just be a made-up word if
            multiple sets are not needed; for instance, the hostname of
            the backup server.  This is used as part of the snapshot
            name.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
