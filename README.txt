simplesnap is a powerful system for transferring ZFS snapshots across
a network.

It has excellent documentation.  See it at:
<https://rawgithub.com/jgoerzen/simplesnap/master/doc/simplesnap.html>

Or, if simplesnap is installed on your system, simply run:

   man simplesnap

See also the examples included in the source distribution.
